  Wazuh Manager: Server running in VMware
  Agent: Windows 10 host (DESKTOP-GSG0OEO)
  Monitored Path: c:\users\ACER\Desktop

ATTACK / SIMULATION STEPS - 

  File Creation: 

    Created a new folder named wazuh project and inside it created a new file named fim.txt.

  Event Detected:

    Aug 24, 2025 @ 15:19:08.393
    Agent: DESKTOP-GSG0OEO
    File: c:\users\acer\desktop\wazuh project\fim.txt
    Action: added
    Description: File added to the system.
    Rule ID: 554
    Level: 5


  File Modification:

    Agent: DESKTOP-GSG0OEO
    File: c:\users\acer\desktop\wazuh project\fim.txt
    Action: modified
    Description: Integrity checksum changed.
    Rule ID: 550

    File: c:\users\acer\desktop\wazuh project\fim.txt
    Action: deleted
    Description: File deleted.
    Rule ID: 553
    Level: 7

OBSERVATION - 

  Wazuh successfully detected all three events (added, modified, deleted) with corresponding rule IDs and alert levels.
  This validates that FIM is working as expected on the Windows agent.
  Alerts were forwarded to the Wazuh dashboard for visibility and correlation.
